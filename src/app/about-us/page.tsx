        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        At SplitGo, we believe in making travel more affordable, convenient, 
        and environmentally friendly. Our platform connects people who are 
        headed in the same direction, allowing them to share rides and split 
        the costs. Founded as a project for BRAC Universityâ€™s CSE370 course, 
        SplitGo is designed to meet the needs of students, commuters, and 
        anyone looking for an efficient, cost-saving way to travel.

        By matching riders with others who share similar routes, SplitGo 
        helps reduce the number of vehicles on the road, cutting down on 
        traffic congestion and carbon emissions while also making transportation 
        more accessible. Our user-friendly platform provides a seamless experience, 
        enabling users to find and connect with ride companions in just a few clicks.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Our Vision</h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
        Our vision is to revolutionize the way people travel by fostering a culture 
        of shared transportation. We aim to make ride-sharing the go-to option for people 
        looking to save money, reduce their environmental impact, and make commuting 
        more social and enjoyable. We envision a future where SplitGo becomes a trusted, 
        everyday tool for travelers, promoting sustainable mobility and transforming the 
        way we think about transportationâ€”one ride at a time.
